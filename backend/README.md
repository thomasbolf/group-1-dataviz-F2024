# AI-Driven Data Visualization Tool

This project is a Flask-based web application designed to create AI-enhanced data visualizations.

## Setup
1. To create a virtual environment: `python -m venv autoviz_env`
2. To activate the env: `source autoviz_env/bin/activate`
3. Install dependencies in the env: `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`
(...This creates an `autoviz` folder containing the installed packages)
4. Set up your OpenAI API key in an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
5. Run the application: `python run.py`
